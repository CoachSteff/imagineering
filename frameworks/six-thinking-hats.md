# Six Thinking Hats: Parallel Thinking for Better Decisions

## Overview

Six Thinking Hats, developed by Edward de Bono, is a method for structured, productive thinking‚Äîespecially in groups. Instead of arguing from fixed positions, everyone "wears" the same hat at the same time, exploring one perspective together before moving to the next.

The result: less ego, less politics, more productive thinking.

**The Core Problem Six Hats Solves:**  
Traditional meetings devolve into argument. One person is optimistic, another is critical, someone else wants data, and someone else just wants to make a decision. Everyone is thinking in different directions, and nothing productive happens.

**The Six Hats Solution:**  
Everyone thinks in parallel. When we're all wearing the White Hat, we're all focused on facts. When we switch to Yellow Hat, we're all exploring possibilities. No one's ego is tied to a position‚Äîwe're all exploring together.

## The Six Hats

### ü§ç White Hat: Facts and Information

**Focus:** Data, facts, information gaps

**Mindset:** Neutral. Objective. What do we know? What do we need to know?

**Questions:**
- What information do we have?
- What information do we need?
- What are the facts (not opinions)?
- Where can we get missing data?

**Avoid:**
- Interpreting data to support your position
- Mixing facts with opinions

**Using AI with White Hat:**
AI is excellent at gathering facts, data, and research. Use it to:
- Find relevant data and statistics
- Summarize research or reports
- Identify information gaps
- Present facts without interpretation

---

### üî¥ Red Hat: Emotions and Intuition

**Focus:** Feelings, gut reactions, intuition (without justification)

**Mindset:** Emotional. Honest. How do I feel about this?

**Questions:**
- What's my gut reaction?
- How do I feel about this option?
- What makes me excited or nervous?
- What's my intuition telling me?

**Avoid:**
- Justifying feelings with logic
- Dismissing emotions as "irrational"

**Using AI with Red Hat:**
AI doesn't have emotions, but it can help you:
- Role-play stakeholder emotional reactions
- Anticipate customer feelings
- Explore "what feels off" about a plan
- Surface unspoken concerns

---

### üñ§ Black Hat: Critical Judgment

**Focus:** Risks, problems, what could go wrong

**Mindset:** Cautious. Protective. What are the risks?

**Questions:**
- What could go wrong?
- What are the weaknesses in this plan?
- Why might this fail?
- What are we overlooking?
- What's the worst-case scenario?

**Avoid:**
- Being cynical (just negative without helping)
- Killing ideas instead of improving them
- Staying in Black Hat too long

**Using AI with Black Hat:**
AI is excellent at identifying risks and edge cases. Use it to:
- Stress-test assumptions
- Identify potential failure modes
- Role-play critical stakeholders
- Surface blind spots

---

### üíõ Yellow Hat: Optimism and Benefits

**Focus:** Opportunities, benefits, why this could work

**Mindset:** Optimistic. Constructive. What's the upside?

**Questions:**
- What are the benefits?
- Why would this work?
- What opportunities does this create?
- What's the best-case scenario?
- How could this be valuable?

**Avoid:**
- Ignoring real risks (that's Black Hat's job)
- Being unrealistically positive

**Using AI with Yellow Hat:**
AI can help you see upside potential. Use it to:
- Identify hidden benefits
- Explore best-case scenarios
- Find analogies where similar ideas worked
- Generate optimistic possibilities

---

### üíö Green Hat: Creativity and Alternatives

**Focus:** New ideas, alternatives, creative solutions

**Mindset:** Creative. Exploratory. What else is possible?

**Questions:**
- What are other ways to solve this?
- What if we tried [X]?
- How might we combine ideas?
- What's a completely different approach?

**Avoid:**
- Critiquing ideas during Green Hat time
- Settling for first idea without exploring alternatives

**Using AI with Green Hat:**
AI excels at generating alternatives. Use it to:
- Brainstorm 20+ variations
- Find analogies from other fields
- Combine ideas in unexpected ways
- Challenge conventional approaches

---

### üîµ Blue Hat: Process Control

**Focus:** Managing the thinking process itself

**Mindset:** Meta. Facilitator. What thinking do we need?

**Questions:**
- Which hat should we use next?
- Have we spent enough time on this perspective?
- What's our agenda for this session?
- How do we summarize what we've learned?

**Roles:**
- Set the agenda (which hats, in which order)
- Enforce hat discipline (keep everyone in the same hat)
- Summarize insights after each hat
- Decide next steps

**Using AI with Blue Hat:**
AI can act as a process facilitator. Use it to:
- Suggest which hat to use for a given challenge
- Keep track of time in each hat
- Summarize insights across hats
- Recommend next thinking steps

## How to Run a Six Hats Session

### Solo Session (30-45 minutes)

**Setup:**
1. Define your challenge or decision clearly
2. Decide which hats you need (you don't always need all six)
3. Use a timer for each hat (5-10 minutes per hat)

**Recommended Sequence:**

**1. Blue Hat (5 min):** Set agenda and decide which hats to use  
**2. White Hat (5 min):** What do we know? What do we need to know?  
**3. Green Hat (10 min):** Generate ideas and alternatives  
**4. Yellow Hat (5 min):** What's promising? What could work?  
**5. Black Hat (5 min):** What are the risks and weaknesses?  
**6. Red Hat (3 min):** How do I feel about the options now?  
**7. Blue Hat (5 min):** Summarize and decide next steps

---

### Team Session (60-90 minutes)

**Setup:**
1. Assign a Blue Hat facilitator (or rotate)
2. Make the current hat visible (slide, poster, or whiteboard)
3. Set ground rules: everyone wears the same hat at the same time

**Process:**

**Opening Blue Hat (10 min):**
- Clarify the challenge
- Agree on hat sequence
- Set time limits

**White Hat (10 min):**
- Share known facts
- Identify information gaps
- Assign research if needed

**Green Hat (15 min):**
- Brainstorm alternatives
- Build on each other's ideas
- No critique allowed

**Yellow Hat (10 min):**
- Explore benefits of each option
- Identify what's promising
- Build positive momentum

**Black Hat (10 min):**
- Identify risks and weaknesses
- Constructive critique
- Surface concerns

**Red Hat (5 min):**
- Quick gut check: How does this feel?
- Everyone shares briefly (no justification needed)

**Closing Blue Hat (10 min):**
- Synthesize insights
- Make decisions or next steps
- Reflect on the process

## Common Hat Sequences for Different Situations

### For Decision-Making:
Blue ‚Üí White ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Black ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Blue

### For Problem-Solving:
Blue ‚Üí White ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Black ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Blue

### For Conflict Resolution:
Blue ‚Üí White ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Black ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Blue

### For Strategic Planning:
Blue ‚Üí White ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Black ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Blue

You don't always need all hats. Choose based on what thinking you need.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Mixing Hats**
Trying to be creative and critical at the same time. Separate the thinking modes‚Äîthat's the whole point.

**Mistake 2: Skipping Hats You Don't Like**
If you're naturally optimistic, you might skip Black Hat. If you're risk-averse, you might skip Yellow Hat. Use all relevant hats for balanced thinking.

**Mistake 3: Staying Too Long in One Hat**
Black Hat sessions that go on too long kill energy. Green Hat without moving to Yellow/Black never produces decisions. Keep moving.

**Mistake 4: Using Hats as Weapons**
"I'm just being Black Hat" is not an excuse to be destructive. All hats should be constructive, even Black Hat.

## Six Hats in Practice: Real Example

**Challenge:** Should we launch a new product feature that customers are requesting but would require significant engineering resources?

**Blue Hat Opening:**
Agenda: White ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Black ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Blue (45 minutes total)

**White Hat (5 min):**
- 200 customer requests for this feature over 6 months
- Engineering estimate: 3 months, 2 full-time engineers
- Current sprint commitments through Q2
- Competitor X launched similar feature last month

**Green Hat (10 min):**
- Could we build a simpler version in 2 weeks?
- What if we partnered with a third-party service?
- Could we pilot with 10 customers first?
- What if we bundled it with another feature to maximize impact?

**Yellow Hat (5 min):**
- Addresses top customer pain point
- Differentiation from competitors
- Could increase retention by 15% (based on similar past features)
- Builds on existing infrastructure

**Black Hat (5 min):**
- Pulls resources from other committed work
- Might not work as well as customers imagine
- Support and maintenance burden after launch
- Competitive advantage might be temporary

**Red Hat (3 min):**
- Team feels excited about the challenge
- Some anxiety about timeline pressure
- Gut says this matters to customers

**Blue Hat Closing (5 min):**
- Decision: Build simplified MVP in 2 weeks, pilot with 10 customers, evaluate before full build
- Next steps: Define MVP scope by Friday, assign team, schedule customer pilots
- Reflection: Black Hat helped us avoid over-committing, Green Hat found a faster path

## Using Six Hats with AI

**Prompt Structure:**

```
I'm using the Six Thinking Hats method to explore [challenge].

Current Hat: [White/Red/Black/Yellow/Green/Blue]

Please help me think through this challenge from [current hat] perspective.

[Describe your challenge and context]
```

**Example Prompts:**

**White Hat:** "Give me the facts and data I need to understand [situation]. What information is missing?"

**Red Hat:** "Role-play different stakeholders and share their likely emotional reactions to [proposal]."

**Black Hat:** "Stress-test this plan. What are the risks, weaknesses, and potential failure modes?"

**Yellow Hat:** "What are the benefits and opportunities if [solution] works well? What's the upside?"

**Green Hat:** "Generate 10 creative alternatives to [current approach]. Think beyond conventional solutions."

**Blue Hat:** "Given this challenge, which Six Hats sequence would be most productive? Suggest an agenda."

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Six Hats + ICE Model:**
- Use Green Hat in Imagine phase
- Use Yellow + Black Hats in Create phase
- Use White + Blue Hats in Execute phase

**Six Hats + Disney Method:**
- Green/Yellow Hats = Dreamer mode
- White Hat = Realist mode
- Black Hat = Critic mode

**Six Hats + Blue Ocean:**
- White Hat: Map current competition
- Green Hat: Brainstorm Four Actions
- Yellow Hat: Identify opportunities
- Black Hat: Test strategy feasibility

---

## Reflection Questions

After using Six Hats:

1. Which hat was easiest for you? Which was hardest?
2. Did the hat discipline help or hinder thinking?
3. What insights came from hats you wouldn't naturally use?
4. How would this session have been different without the structure?

- **Book:** "Six Thinking Hats" by Edward de Bono
- **Training:** de Bono Thinking Systems
- **Application:** Use in meetings, workshops, strategic planning, and solo reflection

**Remember:** The hats are not personality types. You're not "a Black Hat person." Everyone uses all hats‚Äîthe method just ensures we use them one at a time, together. That's where the magic happens. Less arguing, more thinking.
