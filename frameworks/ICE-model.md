# ICE-Model: Innovation, Creativity, Entrepreneurship (English)

## Overview

The ICE-Model stands for Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship. It is a systematic, non‑linear approach that helps individuals and teams discover opportunities, explore diverse ideas, and develop concrete, implementable plans. It trains you to:

- analyze problems and context,
- consider multiple perspectives, and
- generate, refine, and implement ideas effectively.

Use ICE as guidance rather than a rigid sequence. You can move between steps as needed and return to reflection at any moment.

## The Seven Perspectives (non‑linear)

1) PIT — the cockpit  
Reflect on and plan the creative process. This is the meta‑thinking “pitstop” where you step back, check direction, choose techniques, manage time, and agree next steps.

2) PRIKKEL — the trigger  
Name the initial trigger: a problem, theme, dream, or assignment. Build a list when unclear, then converge to one focal trigger.

3) CONTEXT — clarification  
Gather and analyze information. Explore what you know, what you need to know, and how to obtain the missing data. Map stakeholders, constraints, and facts.

4) VRAAG — the core question  
Formulate a desired future (dream) and translate it into a clear, actionable core question and a short briefing that aligns participants.

5) IDEE — ideas  
Brainstorm to generate many alternatives, then converge to a promising base idea. Keep going beyond the first good idea; diversity matters.

6) OPLOSSING — solution  
Develop the base idea into a tangible solution through prototyping, feedback, and iteration until it is effective and feasible.

7) PITCH — presentation  
Craft a compelling story and visuals to present the solution and secure support. Practice, invite feedback, and refine.

Note: these perspectives resonate with Six Thinking Hats (e.g., White=Context, Green=Ideas, Black/Yellow=Critique/Benefits, Blue=PIT meta‑process).

## The ICE Process

- Non‑linear navigation: start where it makes sense (sometimes with an idea), and return to PIT to reflect and re‑plan.  
- Repeat and adapt steps as the work evolves.  
- Favor clarity, brevity, and tangible progress over perfection.

## Techniques (examples)

Use techniques deliberately. Mix divergent (expand) and convergent (select) tools.

### PIT (process reflection)
- Focus: topic, outcomes, timeboxing  
- Discipline: choose technique, hold the step, assign roles  
- Results: summarize, prioritize, agree next actions

### PRIKKEL (trigger)
- Divergent: trigger list, wishful thinking, braindump, images/videos, trends, mindmap, brainwriting  
- Convergent: ABC criteria, S3 (Sort–Merge–Select), hit‑list, PMI, Yellow/Black Hat, intuitive (Red Hat)

### CONTEXT (clarification)
- Divergent: WWW (know/need to know), stakeholders & viewpoints, OPV, observation, empathy map, 5W1H, root causes, journeys, diagrams, interviews, trends  
- Convergent: S3, intuitive (Red Hat), PMI, creative pause

### VRAAG (core question)
- Divergent: future images, wishful thinking, goal/area questions, classic brainstorm, brainwriting, reverse brainstorm, random entry, associations, parallel thinking, mindmap  
- Convergent: S3, criteria matrix, POWER, PPCO, PMI, Yellow/Black/Green Hats, intuitive (Red Hat)

### IDEE (ideas)
- Divergent: classic brainstorm, brainwriting, reversed brainstorm, elegant stealing, random entry, trends, associations, analogies, OPV, “What would … do?”, superheroes, posters, provocations  
- Convergent: S3, COCD‑box, criteria matrix, POWER, PPCO, PMI, Yellow/Black/Green Hats, Love Baby

### OPLOSSING (solution)
- Divergent: analogies, storytelling, role‑play, models, storyboards, photos/video, mock‑ups, simulations, canvases  
- Convergent: S3, POWER, PPCO, PMI, Yellow/Black/Green Hats, intuitive (Red Hat)

### PITCH (present)
- Divergent: SExI (State–Explain–Illustrate), SUCCES (Simple–Unexpected–Concrete–Credible–Emotion–Story), analogies, mindmap, brainwriting  
- Convergent: S3, POWER, intuitive (Red Hat)

## Using AI with ICE

- In PRIKKEL and CONTEXT: collect perspectives, generate stakeholder questions, plan research.  
- In VRAAG: help articulate future state and core question options.  
- In IDEE: generate diverse alternatives and analogies.  
- In OPLOSSING: draft prototypes, scripts, visuals, and test plans.  
- In PITCH: structure narrative, slides, and story.

Always keep human judgment in the loop; use AI to widen options and speed iteration.

## Reflection Prompts

1. Are we in the right perspective now, or should we return to PIT?  
2. What assumption did we surface or challenge?  
3. What’s the smallest artifact we can create next to learn?  
4. Which technique would unlock fresh thinking here?
