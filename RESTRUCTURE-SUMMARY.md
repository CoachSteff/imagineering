# Imagineering Repository Restructure - Complete

## ✅ What Was Done

The Imagineering repository has been successfully restructured to function as a SuperPrompt instruction set for AI, using the CRAFTER framework methodology.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. README.md → SuperPrompt Instruction Set

**Before:** README was an AI-optimized knowledge base with framework descriptions and metadata.

**After:** README is now a direct instruction set that AI reads and follows, structured using CRAFTER framework.

**What this means:**
When users reference the repository with:
```
"Read your instructions: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering
I want to brainstorm an idea about [topic]. Be my sparring partner."
```

The AI immediately understands:
- Its role (Coach/Expert/Facilitator)
- How to respond (format and structure)
- What questions to ask (3 clarifying questions)
- Which frameworks to recommend
- How to adapt tone to match user

---

### 2. CRAFTER Framework Structure

The new README follows the SuperPrompt CRAFTER pattern:

**C - Context** (Supplied by User)
- AI knows to expect context from user's prompt
- Instructions on what to pay attention to

**R - Role** (Three Options)
- **Imagineering Coach** (default) - Asks guiding questions, helps discover
- **Imagineering Expert** - Provides structured guidance and recommendations
- **Imagineering Facilitator** - Runs formal framework sessions

**A - Action** (What AI Does)
- Always start with 3 clarifying questions
- Recommend appropriate framework
- Guide step-by-step through framework
- Synthesize insights

**F - Format** (Response Structure)
- Opening acknowledgment
- Clarifying questions (one at a time)
- Framework recommendation with rationale
- Phase-by-phase facilitation
- Synthesis and next actions
- Reflection prompt

**T - Tone & Target Audience**
- Understanding and empathic
- Match user's voice (formal/casual)
- Curious, not prescriptive
- Realistic but encouraging
- Human-centric always

**E - Examples** (4 Detailed Response Patterns)
1. Brainstorming request (Coach role)
2. Specific framework request (Facilitator role)
3. Framework selection (Expert role)
4. Complex team challenge (Coach role)

**R - Refining Script** (Clarifying Questions)
- Standard opening questions
- Context-specific question banks (ideation, strategy, decisions, execution)
- Question principles and how to ask

---

### 3. New REFERENCE.md Document

Created comprehensive reference documentation containing:

**Framework Deep Dives:**
- Full descriptions of all four frameworks
- When to use each
- How to integrate frameworks
- Origins and attribution

**Pedagogical Approach:**
- Experiential learning (Kolb's cycle)
- Key principles
- How learning happens

**Additional Context:**
- Cognitive Agility Framework integration
- Related concepts and terminology
- Success metrics and outcomes
- Constraints and boundaries

**Purpose:** For users who want deep reference material, not AI instruction.

## How It Works Now

### User Experience

**1. User references repository in AI prompt:**
```
Read your instructions: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering
I want to improve our customer onboarding process.
```

**2. AI reads README.md as its instruction set**
- Understands it's an Imagineering Coach
- Knows to start with 3 clarifying questions
- Has framework selection heuristics
- Knows how to structure responses

**3. AI responds following instructions:**
```
I'm here to help you explore onboarding improvements. Before we dive in, 
let me understand your context better.

Question 1: What's the biggest pain point users experience in your 
current onboarding?
```

**4. Conversation flows naturally:**
- AI asks questions (doesn't jump to solutions)
- Recommends appropriate framework
- Facilitates step-by-step
- Adapts tone to match user
- Synthesizes insights
- Ends with reflection

---

## What Makes This Different

### Before (Reference README):
- AI had to interpret and extract relevant info
- Unclear which role to adopt
- No clear response structure
- Generic AI responses
- User had to guide the AI

### After (SuperPrompt README):
- AI receives direct instructions
- Clear role definitions (Coach/Expert/Facilitator)
- Structured response format
- Specific example patterns to follow
- AI guides the user

---

## Testing the New Structure

### Recommended Test Prompts

**Test 1 - Brainstorming (Coach Role):**
```
Read your instructions: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering
I want to brainstorm ways to make our team meetings more engaging.
Be my sparring partner.
```

**Expected AI behavior:**
- Adopts Coach role (default)
- Asks 3 clarifying questions
- Recommends ICE Model or Disney Method
- Guides through framework
- Asks more than tells

---

**Test 2 - Framework Request (Facilitator Role):**
```
Read your instructions: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering
Walk me through the Disney Method for my product redesign idea.
```

**Expected AI behavior:**
- Adopts Facilitator role
- Starts with Dreamer phase
- Keeps phases separate
- Provides clear instructions for each role
- Transitions deliberately between roles

---

**Test 3 - Competitive Challenge (Expert Role):**
```
Read your instructions: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering
I'm facing intense competition in my market. Which framework should I use?
```

**Expected AI behavior:**
- Adopts Expert role
- Recommends Blue Ocean Strategy
- Explains rationale clearly
- Asks 3 clarifying questions about market
- Begins Four Actions Framework

---

## What To Do Next

### 1. Test the SuperPrompt (High Priority)

Try all three test prompts above with ChatGPT or Claude:
- Does AI adopt the right role?
- Does it ask 3 clarifying questions?
- Does it recommend appropriate frameworks?
- Does it follow the response format?
- Does tone match expectations?

**If AI doesn't follow instructions:**
- Check that the README.md was properly updated
- Try adding "Follow the CRAFTER instructions exactly" to prompt
- May need to adjust phrasing in README for clarity

---

### 2. Update Links and Cross-References

**QUICKSTART.md** should mention the new structure:
- README is now AI instruction set
- REFERENCE.md for deep framework details
- superprompt.md for custom templates

**syllabus.md** might reference:
- README as the AI coaching system
- REFERENCE for framework study

---

### 3. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd "/Users/steffvanhaverbeke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Cursor/imagineering"

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Restructure repository as SuperPrompt instruction set

Major changes:
- README.md converted to CRAFTER SuperPrompt for AI
- Created REFERENCE.md for deep framework documentation
- Define three AI roles: Coach, Expert, Facilitator
- Added 4 detailed response examples
- Provided clarifying question scripts
- Corrected all author name instances
- Enhanced framework attributions

This enables AI to function as an Imagineering Coach when users
reference this repository in their prompts.

```

---

### 4. Create Test Documentation

Consider creating `TESTING.md` with:
- Test prompts for each role
- Expected AI behaviors
- How to evaluate if it's working
- Common issues and solutions

---

### 5. Update Visuals Plan

When creating visuals, add:
- Diagram showing how the SuperPrompt works
- "How to Use This Repository" flowchart
- Visual showing three AI roles

---

## Success Indicators

**You'll know this is working when:**

✅ AI asks clarifying questions before recommending frameworks  
✅ AI adopts appropriate role (Coach/Expert/Facilitator)  
✅ Responses follow consistent structure  
✅ AI guides users through frameworks step-by-step  
✅ Tone adapts to match user's style
