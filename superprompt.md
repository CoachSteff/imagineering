# SuperPrompt for AI-Assisted Imagineering

## What is a SuperPrompt?

A SuperPrompt is a structured instruction set that gives AI the context, role, and frameworks it needs to think alongside you productively. Rather than asking vague questions like "give me ideas," a SuperPrompt turns AI into a specialized thinking partner.

This SuperPrompt is built using the **CRAFTER framework** from the [SuperPrompt Framework](https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt) methodology.

## The Imagineering SuperPrompt

Copy and paste this entire prompt when starting a new AI session focused on innovation and creative problem-solving:

### Prompt Template

```
# Context
I'm working on [describe your challenge, project, or opportunity].

I'm using the Imagineering approach to systematic creative thinking, which draws on frameworks like ICE (Imagine-Create-Execute), Disney's Dreamer-Realist-Critic method, Blue Ocean Strategy, and Six Thinking Hats.

Repository reference: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering

# Role
You are an expert innovation facilitator trained in structured creative thinking methods. Your role is to guide me through a systematic exploration of my challenge using the appropriate Imagineering framework(s).

# Action
Help me [choose one]:
- Apply the ICE model to move from imagination to execution
- Run a Disney Imagineering session (Dreamer → Realist → Critic)
- Develop a Blue Ocean strategy using the Four Actions Framework
- Facilitate a Six Thinking Hats exploration
- Determine which framework(s) best fit my challenge

# Format
Structure your guidance as:
1. **Clarifying questions** to understand my context
2. **Framework selection** with rationale
3. **Step-by-step facilitation** through the chosen method
4. **Synthesis** of key insights and next actions

Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and bold emphasis for key points. Avoid jargon.

# Target Audience
I'm a [your role/background]. I value practical, grounded thinking over abstract theory. I want to use AI as a thinking partner, not as a replacement for my judgment.

# Examples
[Optional: Include a brief example of the kind of output you're looking for, or reference examples from the /examples/ folder]

# Refining Questions
As we work together, ask me:
- What assumptions am I making that might limit possibilities?
- Which stakeholders' perspectives haven't we considered?
- What would success look like if we removed current constraints?
- How might this solution need to adapt as context changes?
```

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Customize the Template
Replace the bracketed sections with your specific context:
- **Context:** What's the actual challenge you're working on?
- **Action:** Which framework feels most relevant, or ask AI to help you choose
- **Target Audience:** Brief description of your role and what matters to you

### Step 2: Start Your AI Session
Open a new conversation in ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI tool and paste the customized prompt.

### Step 3: Engage in Dialogue
The AI will guide you through the framework. Respond honestly, push back when something doesn't fit, and iterate.

### Step 4: Capture Insights
Don't just run the session—document key insights, decisions, and next actions. Treat this as working notes for your innovation project.

## Tips for Better AI-Assisted Innovation

**Do:**
- Be specific about your context and constraints
- Challenge the AI when suggestions feel generic or off-target
- Use the AI to explore "what if" scenarios you wouldn't normally consider
- Ask AI to role-play different perspectives (stakeholders, critics, dreamers)

**Don't:**
- Accept the first answer without probing deeper
- Use AI as a shortcut to avoid doing your own thinking
- Skip the reflection step—that's where learning happens
- Forget that AI doesn't understand your organizational politics or human dynamics

## Advanced Usage: Chaining Frameworks

For complex challenges, you can run multiple frameworks in sequence:

1. **Start with ICE** to clarify where you are (Imagination, Creativity, or Execution phase)
2. **Use Disney Strategy** to explore possibilities and test feasibility
3. **Apply Blue Ocean Strategy** to identify differentiation opportunities
4. **Close with Six Hats** to stress-test from multiple perspectives

Ask the AI to guide you through this sequence, pausing between each to reflect and synthesize.

## Troubleshooting

**"The AI is giving me generic answers"**  
→ Add more specific context about your industry, constraints, and stakeholders. The richer your input, the better the output.

**"I don't know which framework to use"**  
→ Use the prompt exactly as written above and ask the AI to recommend the best framework based on your challenge.

**"The AI keeps suggesting things that won't work in my context"**  
→ Explicitly state your constraints and push back. Good AI facilitation is a dialogue, not a monologue.

**"I'm not sure if the output is useful"**  
→ Step away, reflect, and test one idea in practice. Innovation is proved through experimentation, not through conversation.

## Going Deeper

This SuperPrompt is your starting point. As you use it, you'll develop variations that fit your specific work context.

**Remember:** AI is a thinking partner, not a thinking replacement. The frameworks work because of your judgment, your context, and your willingness to navigate ambiguity. AI just amplifies what you bring to the table.

Now go imagine something better.
