# Visuals Folder

## Overview

This folder contains visual aids and diagrams that support learning the Imagineering frameworks. Visuals help participants understand complex concepts quickly and serve as reference materials during workshops.

## Planned Visual Assets

### 1. ICE Diagram (`ice-diagram.png`)

**Purpose:** Visual representation of the three-phase ICE Model

**Content:**
- Three connected circles or phases: Imagine → Create → Execute
- Key characteristics of each phase (divergent vs. convergent thinking)
- Arrows showing non-linear flow (you can loop back)
- Icons or visual metaphors for each phase

**Use Cases:**
- Workshop slides introducing ICE Model
- Participant handouts
- Social media content explaining the framework

**Design Notes:**
- Should be simple and clean
- Use consistent color palette across all framework visuals
- Ensure legibility at both large (presentation) and small (handout) sizes

---

### 2. Imagineering Cycle (`imagineering-cycle.png`)

**Purpose:** Overview diagram showing how all frameworks connect

**Content:**
- Visual showing ICE, Disney Method, Blue Ocean, and Six Hats
- How frameworks relate to each other
- When to use which framework (decision tree or flow)
- Central theme: Human + AI collaboration

**Use Cases:**
- Course introduction slide
- Repository header/banner
- Quick reference guide

**Design Notes:**
- Should show the relationships between frameworks
- Not just a list—show how they integrate
- Include brief descriptions or keywords for each framework

---

### 3. Disney Method Diagram (`disney-imagineering.png`)

**Purpose:** Visual representation of Dreamer-Realist-Critic roles

**Content:**
- Three distinct roles/personas: Dreamer, Realist, Critic
- Visual metaphors for each (e.g., cloud for Dreamer, ruler for Realist, magnifying glass for Critic)
- Key questions each role asks
- Arrows showing progression through roles

**Use Cases:**
- Workshop slides for Disney Method module
- Printable role cards for group exercises
- Visual reminder during facilitation

**Design Notes:**
- Make each role visually distinct
- Could be illustrated as three physical spaces (like Disney's original method)
- Include brief text for each role's mindset

---

### 4. Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas Template (`blue-ocean-canvas.png`)

**Purpose:** Blank template for creating strategy canvas

**Content:**
- X-axis: Competing factors (customizable)
- Y-axis: Level of investment (1-10 scale)
- Space for plotting current state vs. desired state
- Four Actions Framework reminder (Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create)

**Use Cases:**
- Workshop exercise template
- Participant workbook
- Planning tool for real strategy work

**Design Notes:**
- Should be printable and writable
- Clean grid layout
- Include instructions or legend

---

### 5. Six Thinking Hats Visual (`hats.png`)

**Purpose:** Visual reference for the six hat colors and meanings

**Content:**
- Six hat icons in their respective colors:
  - White Hat (facts/information)
  - Red Hat (emotions/intuition)
  - Black Hat (critical judgment)
  - Yellow Hat (optimism/benefits)
  - Green Hat (creativity/alternatives)
  - Blue Hat (process control)
- Brief description for each hat
- Suggested hat sequences for common scenarios

**Use Cases:**
- Workshop slides for Six Hats module
- Printable reference cards
- Virtual meeting backgrounds with current hat visible

**Design Notes:**
- Use actual hat colors as specified by de Bono
- Could be illustrated as literal hats or abstract colored circles
- Include key questions for each hat

---

### 6. Framework Comparison Matrix (`framework-comparison.png`)

**Purpose:** Help participants choose the right framework for their challenge

**Content:**
- Matrix comparing when to use each framework
- Decision criteria: type of challenge, time available, solo vs. team, etc.
- Quick reference guide

**Use Cases:**
- Course introduction
- Decision support tool
- Quick reference guide

---

### 7. AI + Human Collaboration Model (`ai-human-model.png`)

**Purpose:** Visual showing how AI augments (not replaces) human thinking

**Content:**
- Venn diagram or interaction model
- What AI does well (generation, analysis, speed)
- What humans do well (judgment, context, ethics)
- The overlap: AI-augmented human intelligence

**Use Cases:**
- Course introduction
- Explaining Superworker philosophy
- Social media content

---

## Visual Style Guidelines

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Professional blues and greens (trust, growth)
- Accent: Warm orange or yellow (creativity, energy)
- Neutral: Grays for text and backgrounds
- Avoid: Overly corporate or sterile colors

**Typography:**
- Headers: Bold, clean sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica, Arial)
- Body: Readable at small sizes
- Minimal text—visuals should speak for themselves

**Iconography:**
- Simple, modern, minimalist
- Consistent style across all visuals
- Avoid clichés (lightbulbs for ideas, gears for process)

---

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `ice-diagram.png`
- Include version numbers if iterating: `ice-diagram-v2.png`
- Export in multiple formats:
  - `.png` for digital use (high resolution, transparent background)
  - `.pdf` for printing (vector when possible)
  - `.svg` for web use (scalable)

---

## Tools for Creating Visuals

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Figma:** Collaborative design, easy to share and iterate
- **Canva:** Quick templates for non-designers
- **Miro:** Whiteboarding for workshop visuals
- **Keynote/PowerPoint:** Simple diagrams and exports
- **Procreate/Adobe Illustrator:** Professional illustration
