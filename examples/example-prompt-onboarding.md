# Example: Using the Imagineering Superprompt for Team Onboarding

## Scenario

You're redesigning your company's remote onboarding program. Current onboarding is transactional—new hires complete training modules but don't feel connected to the team. You want to use AI to help you reimagine the experience.

---

## Step 1: Customize the SuperPrompt

Here's how you'd adapt the template for this specific challenge:

```
# Context
I'm redesigning our remote team onboarding program for a 200-person tech company. 

Current state: New hires complete training modules but report feeling disconnected. Survey scores for "feeling part of the team" are 6.2/10. Time-to-productivity is 8 weeks on average.

Goal: Create an onboarding experience that builds genuine connection and accelerates integration, while staying practical for our small L&D team.

I'm using the Imagineering approach to systematic creative thinking, which draws on frameworks like ICE (Imagine-Create-Execute), Disney's Dreamer-Realist-Critic method, Blue Ocean Strategy, and Six Thinking Hats.

# Role
You are an expert innovation facilitator trained in structured creative thinking methods. Your role is to guide me through a systematic exploration of this onboarding challenge using the appropriate Imagineering framework(s).

# Action
Help me determine which Imagineering framework(s) best fit this challenge, then guide me through that framework step by step.

# Format
Structure your guidance as:
1. **Framework recommendation** with rationale for why it fits this challenge
2. **Clarifying questions** to understand my context more deeply
3. **Step-by-step facilitation** through the chosen method
4. **Synthesis** of key insights and next actions

Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and bold emphasis for key points. Avoid jargon.

# Target Audience
I'm a Learning & Development lead with 5 years of experience. I value practical, grounded thinking over abstract theory. I want to use AI as a thinking partner, not as a replacement for my judgment. I need solutions that work with limited resources.

# Examples
I'm looking for concrete ideas like: cohort-based experiences, buddy systems, or interactive culture maps—not generic advice like "improve communication."

# Refining Questions
As we work together, please ask me:
- What assumptions am I making that might limit possibilities?
- Which stakeholders' perspectives haven't we considered?
- What would success look like if we removed current constraints?
- How might this solution need to adapt as our company grows?
```

## Step 2: AI's Response

**AI Framework Recommendation:**

Based on your challenge, I recommend using **ICE Model** combined with **Disney Method**. Here's why:

**ICE Model** helps you:
- Move from imagination (what could onboarding be?) to execution (what can we ship in 6 weeks?)
- Prevent getting stuck in endless brainstorming without action

**Disney Method** helps you:
- Balance visionary thinking (Dreamer) with practical constraints (Realist)
- Stress-test ideas (Critic) before committing resources

This combination works well for redesign challenges where you need both creativity and practicality.

**Before we dive in, a few clarifying questions:**

1. **Resources:** How much time can you dedicate to this redesign project? (e.g., 10 hours/week for 4 weeks?)
2. **Stakeholders:** Who needs to approve this new approach? (e.g., HR, team leads, executives?)
3. **Success Metrics:** Besides "feeling part of the team" scores, what else would signal success? (e.g., retention, productivity, peer connections?)
4. **Constraints:** What are your non-negotiables? (e.g., must work for remote team, can't require expensive tools, must scale as we hire more people?)

Once I understand your context, I'll guide you through the frameworks step by step.

## Step 3: Your Responses

**Your answers to AI's questions:**

1. **Resources:** I can dedicate 20 hours over 2 weeks to design, then we pilot with the next cohort starting in 3 weeks
2. **Stakeholders:** My manager (VP of People) and team leads. CEO is supportive but not directly involved.
3. **Success Metrics:** Connection scores >8/10, time-to-productivity <6 weeks, 90-day retention, and qualitative feedback that people feel welcomed
4. **Constraints:** Must work remotely, can't require new tools (we use Slack, Notion, Zoom), must be manageable for our small team, and should work for both tech and non-tech roles

## Step 4: AI Guides You Through ICE + Disney

**AI's Facilitation:**

Perfect. Let's start with the **Imagine phase** of ICE, using the **Dreamer mindset** from Disney Method.

### Round 1: Imagine + Dreamer (15 minutes)

**Instruction:** Let's dream big. If you had unlimited resources and could create the perfect onboarding experience, what would it look like? Don't worry about feasibility yet—we'll handle that in the next phase.

**Think about:**
- What would make a new hire feel instantly welcomed?
- How could we create early connections with teammates?
- What would make the first week memorable (in a good way)?
- How might we turn onboarding from a checklist into an experience?

**Take 10 minutes to brainstorm. Write down everything—wild ideas are welcome here.**

---

**Your Brainstorm (partial list):**

- Personal welcome video from CEO
- Virtual coffee roulette matching new hires with different team members
- Cohort-based "Day 1 together" experience for everyone starting the same month
- Buddy system (but better than the failed one we tried before)
- Interactive map showing how teams collaborate
- "Choose your own adventure" learning paths based on role
- Gamified first 30 days with missions and badges
- Async video library: "How I got here" stories from current team members
- Monthly "New Hire Showcase" where recent hires present their first project
- Virtual team lunches with random groups

---

**AI's Response:**

Excellent brainstorming! I notice some strong themes:
- **Connection over content:** Most ideas focus on relationships, not just information transfer
- **Cohort experience:** Multiple ideas involve starting together
- **Human stories:** Welcome videos, "how I got here" narratives
- **Structured serendipity:** Coffee roulette, random lunches

Let's move to the **Create phase** using the **Realist mindset**.

### Round 2: Create + Realist (20 minutes)

**Instruction:** Now let's get practical. Looking at your brainstorm, which 3-4 ideas feel most valuable AND feasible given your constraints?

For each idea you select:
1. Sketch what it would actually look like
2. Identify what resources it needs
3. Estimate time to implement

**My suggestion:** Pick ideas that:
- Address connection scores directly
- Are achievable within 2 weeks of design time
- Don't require new tools or big budget
- Can scale as you grow

**Which ideas do you want to develop further?**

---

**Your Selection:**

1. **Cohort-based Day 1 kickoff** (live 90-minute session for everyone starting that month)
2. **Buddy system** (but with clear structure and training this time)
3. **Coffee roulette** (5 structured coffee chats in first 30 days with diverse team members)
4. **Welcome package** (physical swag + personalized welcome video)

---

**AI helps you develop each concept in detail, asking:**

For **Cohort Kickoff:**
- What happens in those 90 minutes?
- How do you handle if only 1-2 people start in a month?

For **Buddy System:**
- How do you match buddies?
- What makes this different from the previous failed attempt?
- What's the time commitment?

For **Coffee Roulette:**
- Who gets matched with whom?
- What structure keeps these from being awkward?
- How do you ensure these actually happen?

[You work through each, creating concrete plans]

---

### Round 3: Critic (10 minutes)

**AI's Facilitation:**

Now let's stress-test this. I'll play the **Critic** role and challenge these ideas constructively. Ready?

**Cohort Kickoff Concerns:**
- What if people join between cohorts? Do they wait a month for the next kickoff?
- 90 minutes feels long for remote—will people stay engaged?
- Who facilitates? If it's you every time, does that scale?

**Buddy System Concerns:**
- What if buddies don't actually follow through?
- How do you avoid pairing two introverts who never connect?
- What happens if a buddy leaves the company mid-onboarding?

**Coffee Roulette Concerns:**
- 5 coffee chats = 5 hours. Will people actually do this on top of their regular work?
- What if matches don't happen due to time zones or schedules?
- Is there a risk these feel forced or transactional?

**Welcome Package Concerns:**
- Personalized videos sound great but time-consuming. Who creates them?
- Physical swag adds cost per hire. What's the ROI?

**For each concern: How would you address these issues?**

---

**Your Responses + Refinements:**

[You work through each concern and adjust the plan]

**Key Refinements:**
- Offer both cohort and 1:1 onboarding options
- Shorten cohort kickoff to 60 minutes with clear agenda
- Create buddy expectations guide + time estimate (2 hours/month)
- Reduce coffee chats to 3 (not 5) in first 30 days
- Make welcome videos optional (only for managers)
- Set up automated reminders for coffee chats

---

### Round 4: Integration (5 minutes)

**AI's Summary:**

Here's your refined onboarding program:

**Core Components:**
1. **Welcome Package:** Swag + optional personalized video
2. **Week 1 Kickoff:** 60-min cohort session (or 1:1 if solo start)
3. **Buddy System:** Structured matching, clear expectations (2 hrs/month commitment)
4. **Coffee Roulette:** 3 structured chats in first 30 days with reminder system

**Success Metrics:**
- Connection scores >8/10
- Time-to-productivity <6 weeks
- Post-onboarding survey feedback

**Next Steps:**
1. Design Week 1 kickoff agenda (by Friday)
2. Create buddy expectations guide (by Monday)
3. Set up coffee chat prompts and reminder system (by Wednesday)
4. Recruit 15 buddy volunteers (by next week)
5. Pilot with April cohort

**Ready to move forward?**

## Step 5: Reflection

After the session, you reflect:

**What Worked:**
- AI's framework recommendation helped me structure thinking instead of jumping to solutions
- Combining ICE + Disney gave me both creativity and practicality
- Critic phase caught real problems I would have missed
- Having AI play different roles (Dreamer, Realist, Critic) kept me from getting stuck in my default thinking mode

**What AI Did Well:**
- Asked clarifying questions that forced specificity
- Generated ideas I wouldn't have thought of
- Challenged assumptions constructively
- Kept me moving through phases instead of getting stuck

**What I Still Had to Do:**
- Make final judgment calls on what to prioritize
- Adapt AI suggestions to my company culture
- Decide what felt authentic vs. what felt forced
- Navigate organizational politics that AI doesn't understand

**Key Insight:**
AI amplified my thinking, but I still drove the process. The frameworks gave both of us structure to work within.

## Your Turn

Use this example as a template for your own challenges:

1. **Customize the SuperPrompt** with your specific context
2. **Answer AI's clarifying questions** honestly and specifically
3. **Work through the framework** AI recommends (or request a different one)
4. **Challenge AI's suggestions** when they don't fit your reality
5. **Document key decisions** and next steps

The goal isn't to get AI to solve your problem. It's to use AI as a thinking partner who helps you solve your own problem more clearly and creatively.
