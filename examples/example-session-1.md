# Example Session 1: Reimagining Team Onboarding

## Context

**Challenge:** Our remote team onboarding feels transactional and disconnected. New hires complete modules but don't feel integrated into the team culture.

**Participant:** Learning & Development lead at a 200-person tech company

**Framework Used:** ICE Model + Disney Method

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

## The Session

### Phase 1: Imagine (ICE Model - 15 minutes)

**Facilitator Prompt:**
"Let's start by imagining the ideal onboarding experience. No constraints. What would make a new hire feel genuinely welcomed, connected, and set up for success?"

**Participant Ideas:**
- Personal welcome video from CEO
- Virtual coffee roulette with team members
- Interactive culture map showing how teams work together
- "Choose your own adventure" learning paths
- New hire cohorts that start together
- Buddy system with someone outside their immediate team
- Live team showcase sessions
- Gamified first 30-day missions
- Async story library: "How I got here" videos from team members

**Key Insight from Imagine:**
"Most of our onboarding is about knowledge transfer. What's missing is connection and belonging."

### Phase 2: Create (ICE Model + Disney Dreamer - 15 minutes)

**Facilitator Prompt:**
"Let's take the most promising ideas and sketch them into a concrete concept. What would this actually look like?"

**Concept Development:**

**Core Elements:**
1. **Pre-Start:** Welcome package (physical swag + personalized video from team)
2. **Week 1:** Cohort-based kickoff (live session with 5-10 new hires starting same month)
3. **Weeks 1-4:** Buddy system + structured coffee chats with 8 team members
4. **Ongoing:** Async story library + monthly "new hire showcase"

**Prototype:**
- Sketch of Week 1 agenda
- Draft buddy matching criteria
- List of coffee chat conversation prompts
- Outline of story library themes

### Phase 3: Disney Realist (15 minutes)

**Facilitator Prompt:**
"Now let's put on the Realist hat. How would this actually work? What resources do we need?"

**Realist Analysis:**

**Timeline:**
- Design phase: 2 weeks
- Pilot with next cohort (starting in 3 weeks)
- Iterate based on feedback
- Roll out company-wide in 6 weeks

**Resources Needed:**
- L&D lead time: 20 hours for design
- Budget: $500 for welcome packages
- Tech: No new tools (use existing Slack, Notion, Zoom)
- Buddy volunteers: Need 15-20 people willing to participate

**First Steps:**
1. Design Week 1 kickoff agenda by Friday
2. Recruit buddy volunteers (email to team by Monday)
3. Create story library template
4. Schedule pilot kickoff for next cohort

---

### Phase 4: Disney Critic (10 minutes)

**Facilitator Prompt:**
"Let's stress-test this. What could go wrong? What are we missing?"

**Critic Feedback:**

**Potential Problems:**
- Buddy volunteers might not follow through
- Story library could feel forced or inauthentic
- Time commitment for buddies might be too high
- What happens if someone starts between cohorts?
- Async content might not get watched

**Improvements:**
- Create clear buddy expectations + time commitment (2 hours/month)
- Make story library optional, not required
- Offer both cohort and 1:1 onboarding paths
- Set up reminder system for coffee chats
- Measure engagement with post-onboarding survey

---

### Phase 5: Integration (5 minutes)

**Final Decision:**
Move forward with pilot using these refinements:
- Week 1 cohort kickoff (required)
- Buddy system with clear expectations (required)
- Coffee chats with 5 (not 8) team members (required)
- Story library as optional resource
- Measure: connection score, time-to-productivity, 90-day retention

**Next Actions:**
1. Design kickoff agenda by EOW
2. Send buddy volunteer email Monday
3. Pilot with April cohort (8 new hires)
4. Debrief with pilot participants after 30 days

---

## Results (3 Months Later)

**Pilot Outcomes:**
- Connection scores increased from 6.2/10 to 8.7/10
- Time-to-productivity decreased by 2 weeks on average
- 100% of pilot participants said buddy system was most valuable element
- Story library had low engagement (validated Critic concern)

**Adjustments for Rollout:**
- Kept cohort kickoff, buddy system, coffee chats
- Dropped story library (wasn't being used)
- Added "new hire AMA" with leadership team
- Created buddy training guide to improve consistency

**Current Status:**
New onboarding program rolled out company-wide. Now part of standard practice with continuous iteration based on feedback.

## Key Learnings

**What Worked:**
- Using ICE to separate dreaming from execution prevented premature critique
- Disney Realist forced us to think practically before committing
- Disney Critic caught real issues that would have derailed pilot
- Focusing on connection (not just content) was the breakthrough insight

**What Didn't Work:**
- Story library sounded good but wasn't actually used (glad we piloted first)

**Framework Value:**
The combination of ICE and Disney Method helped us:
1. Dream bigger than "let's add another training module"
2. Design something concrete and testable
3. Anticipate problems before they happened
4. Ship something real within 6 weeks

## AI's Role in This Session

**How AI Assisted:**

**In Imagine Phase:**
- Generated 20+ onboarding ideas when participant was stuck
- Suggested analogies from other domains (gaming onboarding, community building)

**In Create Phase:**
- Drafted sample coffee chat prompts
- Outlined buddy training guide structure

**In Realist Phase:**
- Created project timeline
- Suggested tools and resources

**In Critic Phase:**
- Identified risks participant hadn't considered
- Offered solutions to potential problems

**Key Insight:**
AI didn't replace human judgmentâ€”it amplified thinking by generating options quickly and challenging assumptions constructively.

## Reflection Questions for Your Own Practice

1. Which phase of this session feels most applicable to your challenge?
2. What would happen if you started with Imagine instead of jumping to solutions?
3. How could combining frameworks (like ICE + Disney) help you think more clearly?
4. Where could AI accelerate your innovation process?
