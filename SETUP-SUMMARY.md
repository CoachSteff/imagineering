## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Review and Customize Content

**Priority: High**
- Review README.md (AI-optimized) to ensure AI tools get proper context
- Read through QUICKSTART.md and adjust tone/language for your audience
- Review syllabus.md to ensure it matches your actual course structure
- Customize superprompt.md with any additional context specific to your approach

### 2. Create Visual Assets

**Priority: Medium**
- Design the visual diagrams outlined in visuals/README.md
- Export in multiple formats (.png, .pdf, .svg)
- Add to visuals/ folder

**Tools suggested:**
- Figma (collaborative design)
- Canva (quick templates)
- Keynote/PowerPoint (simple diagrams)

### 3. Test the SuperPrompt

**Priority: High**
- Try the SuperPrompt with ChatGPT or Claude on a real challenge
- Note what works and what needs refinement
- Update superprompt.md based on your experience

### 4. Add to GitHub

**Priority: High**

Once you're satisfied with the content:

```bash
# Navigate to the imagineering folder
cd "/Users/steffvanhaverbeke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Cursor/imagineering"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Imagineering framework repository"

# Create repository on GitHub (via web interface)
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

**Priority: Low**

To create a web-friendly version:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Select source: main branch, root folder
4. Your site will be at: `https://coachsteff.github.io/imagineering`

This makes the content accessible without GitHub friction.

### 6. Link to SuperPrompt Framework

**Priority: Medium**

Update your existing `superprompt-framework` repository to link to this new Imagineering repo as an example implementation.

Add to superprompt-framework README:
```markdown
## Example Implementations

- [Imagineering](https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering) - Creative problem-solving frameworks for AI-augmented work
```

### 7. Create .gitignore

**Priority: Medium**

Add a .gitignore file to exclude system files:

```
# macOS
.DS_Store

# Backup files
*~
*.bak

# Temporary files
*.tmp
```
