## üí° Launch Strategy Recommendations

### 1. Narrative: Why This Matters Now

**The Story:**
"AI is changing how we work, but most people are using it wrong. They're trying to replace human thinking instead of augmenting it. Imagineering teaches systematic creative problem-solving that leverages AI as a thinking partner while keeping humans in the strategic driver's seat."

**Key Messages:**
- Frameworks that matter in an AI world
- Structured creativity beats random brainstorming
- AI amplifies human capabilities, doesn't replace them
- Open-source knowledge for practical application

### 2. Target Audiences

**Primary:**
- Innovation professionals and consultants
- L&D leaders and facilitators
- Product managers and strategists
- Entrepreneurs and startup founders

**Secondary:**
- AI educators and trainers
- Design thinking practitioners
- Business school professors
- Corporate innovation teams

### 3. Distribution Channels

**Owned:**
- LinkedIn posts and articles
- Personal website/blog
- Email newsletter to existing network
- Workshop and course participants

**Community:**
- Design thinking communities
- AI/ML educator groups
- Product management forums
- Innovation practitioner networks

**Earned:**
- Guest posts on relevant blogs
- Podcast interviews about AI-augmented work
- Speaking engagements at conferences
- Academic citations and references

### 4. Timing Considerations

**Optimal Launch Windows:**
- Early Q1: New year, new skills focus
- Late Q3: Planning for next year's learning
- Avoid: Peak vacation times, major holidays

**Current Context (October 2025):**
- Can launch immediately if needed
- Or hold for January 2026 for maximum impact
- Consider: Do you have upcoming courses that would benefit?
