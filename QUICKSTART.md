# Quick Start Guide for Humans

Welcome to the Imagineering repository! This is your practical starting point for learning creative problem-solving methods that matter in an AI-augmented world.

## What is Imagineering?

Imagineering is the practice of **systematic creative thinking**—where imagination meets engineering. It's a structured approach to innovation that helps you move from "what is" to "what could be."

In a world where AI handles routine tasks, your ability to imagine new possibilities, navigate ambiguity, and synthesize insights across domains becomes irreplaceable. Imagineering teaches you to work **with** AI as a thinking partner, not to compete against it.

## Start Here

### If you're taking an Imagineering course:
1. **Browse the frameworks:** Start with [ICE Model](frameworks/ice-model.md) to understand the basic structure
2. **Try the SuperPrompt:** Use [superprompt.md](superprompt.md) with ChatGPT or Claude on a real challenge
3. **See examples:** Check out [example-session-1.md](examples/example-session-1.md) to see how it works in practice

### If you're exploring independently:
1. **Read the syllabus:** Get oriented with [syllabus.md](syllabus.md)
2. **Pick a framework:** Choose whichever feels most relevant to your current challenge
3. **Apply it:** Use the SuperPrompt to work through your challenge with AI

### If you're a facilitator:
This repository is designed to be forkable and adaptable. Review the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for terms, then remix these materials for your context.

## The Four Core Frameworks

### 1. [ICE-Model](frameworks/ice-model.md)
**Innovation, Creativity, Entrepreneurship**  
Seven non‑linear perspectives (PIT, Prikkel, Context, Vraag, Idee, Oplossing, Pitch) to move from trigger to tested solution.

**Use when:** You want a flexible, structured path from problem framing to solution and pitch

---

### 2. [Disney Imagineering Method](frameworks/disney-imagineering-strategy.md)
**Dreamer → Realist → Critic**  
Separate three thinking modes that conflict when used simultaneously.

**Use when:** You need to balance vision with practicality and risk awareness

---

### 3. [Blue Ocean Strategy](frameworks/blue-ocean-strategy.md)
**Compete by not competing**  
Create uncontested market space through value innovation.

**Use when:** You're tired of competing on the same factors as everyone else

---

### 4. [Six Thinking Hats](frameworks/six-thinking-hats.md)
**Parallel thinking for teams**  
Everyone explores the same perspective together before switching to the next.

**Use when:** Meetings devolve into argument instead of productive thinking

## Using This Repository with AI

One of the most powerful features of this repository is that you can use it as **cognitive context** for AI tools.

When starting a new AI conversation for Imagineering work, include this reference:

```
Context: https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering

I'm working on [describe your challenge]. 
Please use the Imagineering frameworks to help me think this through.
```

This tells the AI to ground its responses in structured thinking methods rather than giving generic advice.

**For detailed guidance, see [superprompt.md](superprompt.md)**

## The Bigger Picture

This Imagineering repository is part of the [SuperPrompt Framework](https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt-framework)—a methodology for designing AI interactions that unlock human potential rather than replace it.

If you're curious about the thinking behind these materials, explore the parent framework.

## Philosophy

These materials are developed by **Steff Vanhaverbeke** (CoachSteff), a specialist in the human side of AI adoption.

**Core belief:** Technology should serve humans, not the other way around.

Imagineering is not about learning to think like a machine. It's about learning to think like yourself—more clearly, more creatively, more strategically—with AI as your thinking partner.
